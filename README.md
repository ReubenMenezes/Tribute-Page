# What this is

This is the first project of the freeCode Responsive Web Design Certification. I originally completed this project in late August 2021 but decided to redo it recently.

You can read the user stories and objective for this project at `objective.md`.


# Reflection

This project was a really fun one. I made a tribute page about Jonas Salk (the inventor of the polio vaccine). Not only did I use the skills I learnt during the freeCodeCamp [Responsive Web Design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design) course but I also learnt new skills such as a style technique known as Glassmorphism. I also learnt how to fix issues, make a pleasant User Interface and how to use CSS the best way possible.
